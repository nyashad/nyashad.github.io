I made use of the AWS SSM Session Manager to provide access to the web application servers.
The reason why i chose this instead of the bastion is because the Bastion;
Like any other infrastructure host, it must be managed and patched.
It accrues a cost while it is running.
While the AWS SSM Session Manager reduces your systemâ€™s attack surface while also offering greater visibility into commands issued on your hosts.

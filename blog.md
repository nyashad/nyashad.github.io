# Streamlining Form Submissions from Elementor to Google Sheets

If you're using Elementor for your website and need an efficient way to store form submissions, integrating Google Sheets via a webhook is a powerful solution. This setup ensures that all form data is automatically recorded in a structured way, making it easy to analyze and manage.

## Why Use Google Sheets?
- **Real-time data storage**: Automatically syncs new form entries.
- **Easy data manipulation**: Sort, filter, and analyze responses without hassle.
- **No coding required**: Simple setup using a webhook.

## Setting Up the Integration
Follow these steps to connect Elementor forms with Google Sheets using a webhook:

### Step 1: Create a Google Sheet
1. Open Google Sheets.
2. Create a new sheet and label the columns to match your Elementor form fields.

### Step 2: Set Up a Google Apps Script
1. Click **Extensions > Apps Script** in Google Sheets.
2. Replace the existing script with the following:

```javascript
function doPost(e) {
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();
  var data = JSON.parse(e.postData.contents);
  sheet.appendRow([data.name, data.email, data.message, new Date()]);
  return ContentService.createTextOutput("Success");
}
```

3. Click the **Deploy** button and select **New Deployment**.
4. Under **Select type**, choose **Web app**.
5. Set **Who has access** to **Anyone**.
6. Copy the generated URL; this will be your webhook endpoint.

### Step 3: Configure Elementor Webhook
1. In Elementor, edit your form.
2. Go to the **Actions After Submit** section.
3. Click **Add Action** and select **Webhook**.
4. Paste the webhook URL from Google Apps Script.
5. Map the form fields to match your Google Sheets column headers.
6. Save the form and test by submitting an entry.

## Verifying the Integration
- Check your Google Sheet to confirm that new form submissions are automatically recorded.
- If you encounter issues, review the **Apps Script execution logs** for errors.

## Conclusion
Integrating Elementor forms with Google Sheets via a webhook is a seamless way to store and manage data. This approach eliminates manual entry and ensures real-time updates. You can further enhance the integration by adding email notifications or data validation scripts.
